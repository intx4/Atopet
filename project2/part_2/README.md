## Jupyter files
Overall we have 2 two notebooks:
- de_anon.ipynb
- global_POI.ipynb

The first contains code for exploratory analysis of `queries.csv` dataset, as well code for attacks 1 and 2
of the report, and the evaluation of the defence mechanism (for that check also `grid.py`).  
The second contains code for attack 3 of the report.
To run the notebooks, just run each cell sequentially.
It should automatically install every library it needs.  
The folder contains also .csv files that represent the results of the attacks described in the paper,
plus other .csv files generated during the preliminar analysis. **NOTE that `de_anon.ipynb` must be ran before `global_POI.ipynb` as it generates preliminary analysis.**

The folder contains also other sub directories, that mainly contain data and their plots used in the report.
