Some Features used by "https://www.freehaven.net/anonbib/cache/wpes11-panchenko.pdf" plus filtering and cleaning

CLEANING:
1 - The max size of packets without running the protocol is 609, suggestion is to remove packet of length lower then 615
2 - Removed TCP acks from server

FEATURES
1 - Count of all incoming pkts from server
2 - incoming as fraction of total: incoming pkts / total pkts
3 - Markers: how many time the direction of flow changes
4 - Outgoing pkts as fraction of total pkts
5 - Total bytes sent / total bytes
6 - total bytes received
7 - total bytes
8 - incoming pkts /outgoing pkts
9 - total packets
10 - incoming pkt size mean
11 - 13 Top 3 Bursts time: from the mean, find the time at which the 3 biggest packets > mean size were sent
14 - 16 Top 3 Bursts position: which are the pkt numbers of the top 3 bursts?
17 - 18 Percentage fluctuation in packet size: find the middle packet. Compute the ratio middle size / first packet size
        and last packet size / middle packet size
19 Average time between incoming pkts
